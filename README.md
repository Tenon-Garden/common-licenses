# Licenses

This is a repository of pre-configured plaintext license files for use in __TenonGarden Productions__ software development.

Please refer to license files and/or linked documentation concerning the licensing restrictions of the license files themselves.

These are plaintext (`*.txt`) files, but in most software applications the license will be in a plaintext file with no extension, named: `LICENSE`.

In `bash` the `cp` command can be used to copy and rename any of these license files into your project directory.

```bash
cp [src/source.txt] [dst]/LICENSE;
```
